-- Contribution Instructions --

Issue Assignment:
Only attempt a contribution after the issue has been officially assigned to you.

Eligibility for Issue Assignment:
Requests for issue assignment will only be considered one week after the video on the same project goes live. The first person to request the issue after the one-week period will be assigned the issue.

Meeting Requirements for Bounty:
Ensure that you fulfill all the conditions outlined in the issue to be eligible for the bounty.
If your submission is not selected for the bounty, rest assured that your code will not be used in the production code.
Contributions that fail to adhere to the specified requirements will be deleted to maintain fairness and ensure a level playing field for everyone.

Practice Opportunities:
These issues are designed for everyoneâ€™s practice, so avoid giving or seeking hints before the first successful submission.

Post-Resolution Discussions:
Once the issue is successfully resolved and closed, new contributions can still be merged, but without a bounty.
The bounty is awarded to the first satisfactory submission only.
After the first resolution, the comment thread may be used for discussions and hints.

Bounty Limitations:
Each person is eligible for only one bounty across all issues.

Bounty Credit:
Please note there may be some delay in processing the bounty.
If it has been more than 3 days, feel free to message me on LinkedIn for follow-up.
