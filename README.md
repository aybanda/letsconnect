-- Contribution Instructions -- 

Kindly fulfill all the desired conditions mentioned in an issue to be eligible for the bounty. Don't worry if your submission is not selected for bounty, your code will not be used in the production code. 

If your contribution does not adhere to the things mentioned in the issue, then it will be deleted because these issues are for everyone's practise and to provide a level playing field for everyone, we do not want any hints for anybody. 

After an issue is successfully resolved, then new contributions can be merged but without a bounty. The bounty awarded is just for a single first satisfactory contribution only. 

The comment thread can be used for discussions and hints post the first successful submission of the solution to an issue but not before that. 

Only one bounty is allowed for a single person. 

Kindly expect some delay in bounty credit, and message me on Linkedin if it has been more than 3 days.
